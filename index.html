    <h2><p><i>Albert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. Six weeks later the family moved to Munich, where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they moved to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. he accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905 he obtained his doctor’s degree.<br>
       <br> During his stay at the Patent Office, and in his spare time, he produced much of his remarkable work and in 1908 he was appointed Privatdozent in Berne. He became a German citizen in 1914 and remained in Berlin until 1933 when he renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America to take the position of Professor of Theoretical Physics at Princeton*. He became a United States citizen in 1940 and retired from his post in 1945.</i></p></h2>

           <h1>E=mc^2</h1>
           <div class=" visible content">
            <p>E = mc2, equation in German-born physicist Albert Einstein’s theory of special relativity that expresses the fact that mass and energy are the same physical entity and can be changed into each other. In the equation, the increased relativistic mass (m) of a body times the speed of light squared (c2) is equal to the kinetic energy (E) of that body.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="invisible-content">
            <p>In physical theories prior to that of special relativity, mass and energy were viewed as distinct entities.</p>

            <h1>Balck hole</h1>
            <div class=" visible content">
             <p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light or other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape its event horizon.[2] The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="invisible-content">
             <p>Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace.[8] In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found the first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole. David Finkelstein, in 1958, first published the interpretation of "black hole" as a region of space from which nothing can escape.</p>

            <div class=" visible content">
             <p>Outside Mexico City lies the ancient pyramid complex of Teotihuacan, which, according to the oral tradition of the Ruiz family, is the spiritual center for the Toltec people. For over twenty years, don Miguel Ruiz Jr. has been traveling to Teotihuacan to teach others about the powerful mysteries found there.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="invisible-content">
             <p>In The Mastery of Life, Ruiz explains how the sacred pyramids and plazas of Teotihuacan act as symbolic stops on the transformative path of Toltec Warriors—those who apply the teachings of the Toltecs in their own lives to win the inner war against the forces of domestication, fear, and self-judgment</p>
